# command_sequence index
# [1] command:
#   1. takeoff = Taking off sequence
#   2. hold = Wait for certain time
#   3. goto = Move to location
#   4. goto_velocity = Move to location with velocity control
#   5. external = Wait for external command
#   6. land = Landing sequence
# [2] to wait before the next command:
#   1. conc = Go to the next command without waiting for this
#   2. wait = Wait for this command
# [3] drone number involved
#   1. "all"
#   2. "cfX" = split the cfs by underscore etc "cf1_cf2_cf3"
# [4] duration (only applicable to hold) in ms, if nothing leave empty ""
# [5] pose in XYZ "1 1 1", if nothing leave empty ""
